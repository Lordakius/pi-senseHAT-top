\frametitle{How can we check if our program reacts to changing workload?}
We have written a few extra programs that utilize forks and some random
	calculations to change the workload.

	This was intended to be controlled by the joystick, but discarded as the
	change in the workload is no goal of the program itself.
	\begin{lstlisting}[tabsize=2]
	int main(void) {
		fork();
		size_t i = 0;
		while(1)
			i++;
	}
	\end{lstlisting}
